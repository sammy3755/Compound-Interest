# Negative Compound Interest Exploration

This repository explores the concept of "negative compound interest." This is a theoretical 
exploration of how compounding might work with negative interest, not a standard financial term.  
Traditional compound interest involves exponential growth; this project examines exponential decrease 
with negative rates.

## Contents:

* `negative_compound_interest.py` - Python code modeling negative compound interest over time 
with various scenarios.

## Key Concepts & Assumptions:

* **Negative Interest Rate:**  Represents a decreasing principal over time.
* **Compounding Frequency:**  How often the negative interest is applied (e.g., daily, monthly, annually).
